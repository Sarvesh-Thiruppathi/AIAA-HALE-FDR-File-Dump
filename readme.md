2)Upload the ``Arduino-FDR-Dump.ino`` file onto the Arduino board

3)Download the ``Save-FDR-Data-From-Serial.py`` file onto your computer and install pyserial using ``python -m pip install pyserial``

4)Be sure to change the port in line 5 of the ``Save-FDR-Data-From-Serial.py`` to match the port your Arduino is connected to

5)Ensure the baud rate is set correctly on line 5 of ``Save-FDR-Data-From-Serial.py`` and line 15 of ``Arduino-FDR-Dump.ino``

6)Run ``Save-FDR-Data-From-Serial.py``. A directory with all the files from the FDR should be created in the same directory as your Python file
